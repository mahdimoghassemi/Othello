## Introduction

Welcome to the Othello Game in C! Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic two-player board game known for its elegant simplicity and deep strategy. This C program lets you enjoy this timeless game right from your terminal.
In this project, I have developed an Othello game play using the C programming language. Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic board game where two players compete to have the majority of their colored discs on the board at the end of the game.

The objective of my project was to create a code that could play against a tester and ultimately win the game. To achieve this, I implemented various algorithms and strategies to make intelligent moves and outmaneuver the opponent.

The code I wrote for this project utilizes a combination of techniques. These techniques allow the program to evaluate different possible moves and choose the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's opportunities.

Throughout the development process, I focused on optimizing the code for efficiency and speed. This involved carefully designing data structures to represent the game board and implementing efficient algorithms for move generation and evaluation.

To test my program's capabilities, I played multiple games against a tester who made random moves. The goal was to demonstrate that my code could consistently make strategic decisions that would lead to victory.

Overall, this project showcases my proficiency in C programming and my ability to develop complex algorithms for game playing. By successfully creating a code that can play Othello against a tester and win consistently, I have demonstrated my understanding of artificial intelligence concepts and problem-solving skills in programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the game, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **C Compiler:** You'll need a C compiler to build and run the program. GCC is recommended.

### Compilation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/othello-game.git
   cd othello-game
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:**

   ```bash
   gcc othello.c -o othello
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Game:**

   To initiate the Othello game, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   ./othello
   ```

2. **Gameplay:**

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves. The computer opponent will respond with its moves.
   - The game continues until there are no legal moves left or the board is full.
   - The game will display the winner or a draw when it concludes.
